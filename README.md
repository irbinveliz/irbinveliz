- Hi, I’m Irbin, from Spain. I am currently doing my PhD in the Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics Group (https://www.consevol.org/) at the Doñana Biological Station (Seville - Spain), under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Leonard. The focus of my research is how selection acts on an altitudinal gradient in populations of non-volant small mammals in Southeast Asia. 
- I hold a BSc in Biology, with a focus on environmental biology, and a Master's degree in Biodiversity in the tropical areas and its Conservation.
- I’m interested in conservation biology and genetics. My goal is to integrate the data obtained from DNA with conservation measures. 
- I also love being outdoors. Until now, I have had the chance to sample/monitor lizards, birds, bats, small mammals and freshwater ecosystems.
