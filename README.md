- Hi, I’m Irbin, from Spain 😃. I am currently doing my PhD in the Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics Group (https://www.consevol.org/) at the Doñana Biological Station (Seville - Spain) 🐱, under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Leonard. The focus of my research is how selection acts on an altitudinal gradient in populations of non-volant small mammals 🐀 in Southeast Asia 🌏. 
- I hold a BSc in Biology, with a focus on environmental biology, and a Master's degree in Biodiversity in the tropical areas and its Conservation.
- I’m interested in conservation biology and genetics 🧬. My goal is to integrate the data obtained from DNA with conservation measures. 
- I also love being outdoors 🌊🏞️🚴. Until now, I have had the chance to sample and monitor lizards 🦎, birds 🐦, bats 🦇, small mammals 🐁 and freshwater ecosystems.
